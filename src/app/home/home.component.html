        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            According to the Urban Mobility Report, congestion caused 4.3 billion hours of travel delay and 1.7
            billion gallons of wasted fuel in 2020. Traffic Engineering discipline prides itself on offering the
            mobility choices to reduce congestion and emissions.

            The TransTech Lab (TTL) was established as part of TechMRT in fall of 2004 when Dr. Hongchao Liu was
            brought to the university.
        </p>
        <p>Welcome to the TransTech Lab, where innovation and transportation intersect. Our journey began in 2004, when we became an integral part of the Texas Tech Center for Multidisciplinary Research in Transportation (TechMRT). Since then, we’ve been at the forefront of cutting-edge technology, with a focus on revolutionizing traffic safety and traffic operation using emerging roadside LiDAR technology. 
        </p>
        <p>Our mission extends beyond the lab’s walls, as we actively engage in a multitude of real-world projects. From optimizing traffic signal timings and coordination to data-driven traffic safety initiatives, and the development of microscopic simulation models for in-depth traffic impact analysis, we’re constantly striving to improve the world of transportation. </p>
        <p>Our commitment to nurturing the future of transportation truly sets us apart. Students play a pivotal role in our work, collaborating closely with our team to gain valuable real-world experience. Together, we’re addressing the existing challenges in the field, making a tangible impact on the way we move and connect. Join us on this exciting journey where innovation meets transportation, and together, we’ll pave the safer, more efficient future.
